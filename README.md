## Non-Logged Users
On launch, you are able to browse messages by navigating to city pages using the pins on the world map.  

For now, we have designed webpages for three cities:
* Toronto
* Montr√©al
* Paris

After accessing the city page, the following information will be displayed on the left-hand side:
* A Safety Information panel which can be accessed by clicking the "i" symbol.  
* The latest data on the total, active, and recovered COVID-19 cases in the city
* An interactive Poll Question related to COVID-19

Messages left by other users are displayed in the city's timeline. You can click on the pin icon to view the location of each message on the city map.  

Note: A non-logged user cannot add their own messages.

## Users

### Login Credentials for User

You can click the "Login" button and use the following credentials to login as a user:
* username: user
* password: user

You can also click the "Sign-Up" button and create your own user profile! You will automatically be logged in after a successful registration.

### Instructions for User

Once you become a user, you are able to add messages to your own city. 

Navigate to your city and click the "New Message" button. You can enter any personal thoughts into the textbox and even set a specific location onto the city's map.

After you click "Post", your message will be sent to an Admin to be approved before being published to all users.

You can also access your personal profile page by clicking on your username in the top-right corner.  

This page lets you access a list of all of your personal messages (including the ones that have not been approved yet).

Press the "Settings" tab to modify your personal settings. You can change your username, password, date-of-birth, and privacy options.

Setting your profile to "Private" will display "anonymous" instead of your username for your messages. Also, other users will not be able to access your profile page.

An Admin will still be able to view your page, even if it is set to Private.

Note: You can access other user personal profiles by clicking on the username in their messages.  

## Admin

### Login Credentials for Admin

An administrator has access to Admin Control. Login using the following credentials to become an admin:
* username: admin
* password: admin

### Instructions for Admin

Click on the "admin" name in the top-right corner to access the admin profile.  

The admin control displays a table of information for all users.

The usernames are linked to each of their profile pages (simply click on the username). Users can be deleted using the "Edit" button.  

The admin control also displays a list of pending messages that need to be reviewed before being published to all users. 

In addition, the Published tab displays all Published messages. Any Published messages that were mistakenly approved can be deleted using the "Edit" button.

The Polls tab lets you view all created polls and the number of votes for each option. You can create new polls and delete preexisting ones. 

You can also activate and deactivate polls using the "Edit" button. Only one poll can be active across all cities.
